<sub> K not much to say. You can call me Misty. C+H is fine even if it's not in my name unless with friends. Pronouns are not a very big concern for me so I'm fine with any except neos cause I know nothing about those. W2i so I don't miss what you say. I have ADHD but that won't impact how I interact with you I may just miss something you said and respond a bit late. I'm not very good at starting convos and can be awkward at times but I will try (Sorry Gavin lol). I make kys/kms jokes but mostly with people I'm close with so you probably won't have to worry about that if you don't like that stuff.

##### Basic dni.

 <sub> If you're sitting the slightest bit on top of me ima get pressed and hide you ðŸ˜­. Unless it's c+h :) (I don't do this very often dw) I will also hide you if you have  Gojo cos cause yes. (THAT MAN IS NOT FUCKING HOT FOR CHRIST SAKE) 
 
Ladies this yo man?
